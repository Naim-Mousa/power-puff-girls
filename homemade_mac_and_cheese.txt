Homemade Mac and Cheese 
This classic baked mac and cheese recipe with a buttered bread crumb topping is creamy and comforting.It's easy to make the cheese sauce from scratch on your stovetop, starting with a roux and adding milk, Cheddar, and Parmesan, resulting in a rich, decadent sauce that coats every nook and cranny of the noodles.Serve this comfort-food macaroni and cheese casserole with grilled meats, sloppy Joes, fried chicken or alongside a salad for a meatless dinner.
8 ounces uncooked elbow macaroni,1/4 cup salted butter,3 tablespoons all-purpose flour,2 1/2 cups milk,2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese,1 1/2 cup finely grated Parmesan cheese,salt and ground black pepper to taste
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and grease an 8-inch square baking dish.Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.Add macaroni and simmer, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; it will finish cooking in the oven.Drain and transfer to the prepared baking dish.While the macaroni is cooking, melt 1/4 cup butter in a medium skillet over low heat.Whisk in flour and stir until the mixture becomes paste-like and light golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes.Gradually whisk 2 1/2 cups milk into the flour mixture, and bring to a simmer.Stir in shredded Cheddar and finely grated Parmesan cheeses; season with salt and pepper.Cook and stir over low heat until cheese is melted and sauce has thickened, 3 to 5 minutes, adding up to 1/2 cup more milk if needed.Pour cheese sauce over macaroni and stir until well combined.Bake in the preheated oven until macaroni and cheese is bubbling, about 30 minutes.
