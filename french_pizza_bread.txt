French Pizza Bread
If you’re in the mood for pizza but don’t want to deal with making the pesky dough, just grab the neatest loaf of French bread which will make for a delicious pizza “crust” that will get crispy on the outside, while staying nice and soft on the inside.It’s truly the best of both worlds.As for toppings, we went the classic pepperoni route, but there's no reason you can't keep it vegetarian with mushrooms, peppers, and onions, or add in some sausage for a meat lover's pizza.This meal yields 4 servings and takes 45 minutes in total to make.
1 loaf French bread,4 tbsp of melted butter,2 cloves of minced garlic,1 cup marinara or pizza sauce,1 1/2 cup shredded mozzarella,Pepperoni slices,2 tbsp freshly grated Parmesan,Crushed red pepper flakes,Freshly chopped basil
Preheat oven to 400°.Slice bread in half lengthwise.Mix melted butter and garlic together and brush all over cut side of bread.Bake for 10 minutes to lightly toast.Spread marinara on top and top with mozzarella, pepperoni slices, parmesan, and red pepper flakes.Bake again until cheese is melty, 10 minutes more.Top with basil to serve
