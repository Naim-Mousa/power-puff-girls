Working Remotely 2022 Java Project

This digital recipe book is a Java program that utilizes object-oriented programming concepts, which allows users to create, retrieve, edit, and browse recipes at its core. The interface of this program is a simple command line interface that prompts the user to input their recipes into the system.

To run the program, simply type "javac Recipe.java" and "javac RecipeBook.java" in the terminal to compile the two java files. Then to run the program, type "java RecipeBook".

The Recipe.java file contains the Recipe class which is used to isntantiate objects of recipes that are uploaded, edited, and viewed by the user.
It conatins "setter" and "getter" methods for the attributes of the Recipe class, the "displayRecipe" method for printing an entire recipe, and the "displaySteps" method for printing each step of instructions of the recipe.

The RecipeBook.java file contains the main method which includes the UI and various methods used to carry out the functionalities of the program. Also note that the recipe book program contains 3 prexisting recipes called Black Bean Tostadas, French Pizza Bread, and Egg Salad. We have provided text files for those recipes as well. In addition, we have provided 3 extra recipe text files for the recipes: Avocado Toast, Chocolate Protein Balls, and Butternut squash soup. As the user, you can choose to upload these extra recipes to your program or not.
